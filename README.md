# Telegram RSS Feed

A simple and easy to deploy RSS feed for your Telegram channels built with GramJS and Express. This app allows you to distribute messages from your Telegram channels to RSS feeds.

Then you can subscribe to the feed and distribute the messages to your audience on other platforms.

## One-Click Deploy

Deploy the app using [Vercel](https://vercel.com):

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https://github.com/artabr/tg-rss-feed&project-name=tg-rss-feed&repository-name=tg-rss-feed)

Please deploy your own copy of the repository to your own Vercel account. It's free and easy to do.

Do not use my Vercel deployment as it may go down at any time.
